I. Introduction

i.	Description and Origin of Data 

The dataset used in this analysis was originally compiled from multiple sources by David Harrison Jr. and Daniel L. Rubinfeld in their article titled “Hedonic Housing Prices and the Demand for Clean Air” which was published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management in 1978. The dataset contains 506 observations across 14 variables. 

ii.	A question of interest

The question investigated in this report is how the level of air pollution, represented by the nitric oxide levels (NOX), is affected as a function of other variables. 
According to Wikipedia, Nitrogen oxides (NOx) refers to a mixture of compounds such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Nitrogen oxides occur naturally and also are produced by man's activities. The primary source of man-made nitrogen oxides is from the burning of fossil fuels. Nitrogen oxides help form acid rain and can also cause a wide range of health and environmental damage. By identifying what factors might be associated with the nitric oxide levels, proactive steps can be planned to limit nitrogen oxides emissions, thus to improve the air quality.
